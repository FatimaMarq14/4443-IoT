# Servo Intro

The following is where I am getting comfortable with the arduino. Here I will go over different mini projects that I tested to get introduced to the basics.

### Connection Schematic
*insert image

A connection schematic, also known as a wiring diagram, is a visual representation of how electrical components are physically connected in a circuit. Here I used:
- (1) x Elegoo Uno R3
- (1) x servo (SG90)
- (4) x M-M wires (Male to Male jumper wires)

A servo can only rotate 180 degrees. Its conrolled by sending electrical pulses that then tell the servo which positions to move. 

### How It Works:
- The servo has 3 wires
  - brown
  - red

### Arduino Code:
```cpp
